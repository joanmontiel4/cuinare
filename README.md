# Cuinare

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Context

This project was created by me (Joan Montiel) as a part of my studies at ISDI Coders Frontend Dev bootcamp. The main purpose of this web application is to allow me to practice most of the content covered during the bootcamp. Although, this project is not conceived to result in a final product it is developed to include most of the necessary features to be a final product. The work is still in progress, and I plan to keep adding new features and improvements for as long as I can.

## App description

### `name`

The word **cuinare** is the result of combining two other words: 1) **cuina**, the catalan (valencian) word for kitchen and 2) **recipe**, including only its first two letters.
